  creating react app
  ----
    1. React JS App based on JS 
    2. React JS App based on TS [RECOMMENDED]

  options in build system  
  ----  
    1. webpack - popular build system [CHOSEN]
    2. vite -- modern build system

Component in ReactJS 
=====
  Skeleton of a component
    * imports (optional)
    * component defn 
       must return JSX
    * export 

  Types of Components 
  -----
    1. Functional Components [RECOMMENDED]
      1.1 Functional Component with Named Function
      1.2 Functional Component with Anonymous Function
      1.3 Functional Component with Arrow Function [RECOMMENDED]

    2. Class Components [NEVER EVER WRITE IT - NOT RECOMMENDED]

  
Naming Conventions & Casing Conventions

Casing Types
  1. PascalCase 
      * Recommended for Interface in TypeScript 
      * Recommended for React Components and the folder of Components

      examples 
      ---
        class CarDetails {

        }

        interface Employee {

        }

  2. camelCase 
      * Recommended for variables, const, functions, methods in JS & TS 
      * Recommended for id's of html elements 
      * Recommended for variables, const, fn, methods, event handlers of React Component
      * Recommended for CSS classes if you are using CSS Modules in react app
      
      examples 
      -----
        var myCar = 'BMW';
        let isLoggedIn = true;

        function getCarInfo() {
          //....
        }

  3. kebab-case
      * Recommended for URLs 
      * Recommended for file names, folder names, assets in front end projects  
      * Recommended for css classes 

      examples 
      -----
        btn-primary
        slideshow-container 
        youtube-logo.png 

  4. snake_case 
    * never ever use this. 
    * okay for const in JS & TS if architect accepts

    examples
    ---
      const MAX_STUDENTS_PER_CLASS = 30;
      const maxStudentsPerClass = 30;

Thinking in ReactJS
-----
  0. Identify the number of components 
  1. Breaking the UI into component hierarchy 
  2. 
  3. 


=====
  Choices in UI Library 
    1. Material UI 
    2. Bootstrap [Chosen]
      2.1 raw bootstrap 
      2.2 react-bootstrap
      2.3 reactstrap
    3. Ant Design
    4. Tailwind CSS 

======



=====
Project Structure 
-----
  src/
    layouts/
      Header.tsx 
      Footer.tsx 
    components/
    pages/
      Home.tsx
    models/
    App.tsx 
    App.css 
    App.test.tsx 
    index.tsx 
    index.css


Limitations of JSX 
======
  1. JSX elements must be closed. either with a self-closing tag or with a closing tag.
  2. JSX elements can't have class attribute. replace it with className.
  3. JSX elements can have style attribute with objects in styles 
  4. JSX expressions must have one parent element. use Fragment instead


Core Concepts of ReactJS
-----
  1. Props [DONE]
  2. States [DONE]
  3. Events [DONE]
  4. Conditional Rendering [DONE]
  5. Lists & Keys [DONE]

====

Characteristics of SPA
  1. Pages should NOT Refresh [DONE]
  2. URL should change [DONE]
  3. History should be maintained w/o page refresh  [DONE]
  4. Header and Footer should NOT be loaded again and again  [DONE]
  5. The section in b/w Header and Footer should show contextual updates [DONE]
  6. Active Menu should be set [TODO]
  7. Page Title should be updated [TODO]

using react-router-dom 

Routing 
=====
  Step 0: Install react-router-dom
    npm install react-router-dom

  Step 1: Identify the urls for the menus
    1. Home                       url: '/'
    2. Netflix                    url: '/netflix'
    3. Employee Manager App       url: '/employee-manager'
    4. Products                   url: '/products'
    5. Todos                      url: '/todos'
    6. About                      url: '/about'
    7. Contact                    url: '/contact'

  Step 2: Creating the components for the urls 
    src/
      pages/
        HomePage.tsx 
        NetflixPage.tsx
        EmployeeManagerPage.tsx
        ProductsPage.tsx
        TodosPage.tsx
        AboutPage.tsx
        ContactPage.tsx

  Step 3: Configure the routes in App.tsx
    and also put the whole app under BrowserRouter

  Step 4: Check the app. Pages will refresh. Let's fix it. 
    Goto MenuList.tsx 
    replace all a href with Link to

Cross Component Communication
------
  1. Parent Component to Child Component Communication [DONE]
      using Props  

  2. Child Component to Parent Component Communication [DONE]
      using Props, states, events and callback function

  3. Any Component to Any Component Communication
      3.1 using React Context API (or)
      3.2 using Redux-Toolkit / zustand / recoil / mobx

Demo of Styles 
------
  * external styles [DONE]
  * internal styles [DONE]
  * inline styles [DONE]
  * CSS Modules [DONE]
  * SCSS [DONE]

Demo Two Way Binding [DONE]
-----
  * controlled component -- 


CRUD App
----
  * Add Employee [ DONE]
      localhost:3000/employee-manager/add
      HTTP Method: POST

  * List Employees [ DONE]
      localhost:3000/employee-manager/
      HTTP Method: GET

  * Employee Details [DONE]
      localhost:3000/employee-manager/1
      localhost:3000/employee-manager/32456

      HTTP Method: GET

  * Update Employee [TODO]
      localhost:3000/employee-manager/32456   (Bootstrap Modal) -- or else 
      localhost:3000/employee-manager/32456/edit  

      HTTP Method: PUT / PATCH 
  
  * Delete Employee [TODO]
      localhost:3000/employee-manager/32456/   (Bootstrap Modal)
      HTTP Method: DELETE

==========


Context API 
------
  * createContext 
  * pass the data through the context (ContextProvider)
  * access the context data in any component using useContext
